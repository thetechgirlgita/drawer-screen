<h1 align= "center"> Drawer Screen </h1>
<p>In the modern app like #Gmail products and #Linkedin, we can see similar drawer functionality which is revealing new screen layer by sliding from corner. This functionality allows user to navigate freely across the screens. Let's look at a #flutter version of the same drawer functionality.
I have built a mini flutter project with the #drawer #widget. On the left side of the screen, I have captured my #code and on the right side, I am showing a #demo.
